# Python-Jobs-Analysis
## Aim  
This project is meant to provide insights to the python job market and to answer the following questions amongst others.  
1. What kind of jobs are available to python developers?  
2. What tools and skills alongside Python are employers looking for?  
  
## How?
To achieve this project, the following steps were taken
1. Jobs alongside their descriptive information was scraped from python.org Jobs Board, www.python.org/jobs/  using python's html.parser module.  
2. Data was stored in a csv format.
3. Analysis and visualization was done using some Python libraries(seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy)

## Limitations
Considering that this dataset was drawn strictly from Python's Job Board, a major issue was having a rather small sample set, considering not all python jobs make it to python.org
